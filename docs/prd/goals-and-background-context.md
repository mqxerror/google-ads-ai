# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- **Enable SMB owners to manage ALL Google Ads campaign types with AI assistance** — reducing expertise barrier and time investment from 10-20 hours/month to <5 hours/month
- **Provide an Airtable-style Smart Grid as the primary UI surface** — data-first experience where users see, filter, and act on campaigns/ads/keywords in a spreadsheet-like interface
- **Support multi-account portfolio management from Day 1** — users with 2-50 accounts can switch context instantly and see cross-account insights
- **Deliver AI-powered analysis AND structured actions** — chat for complex queries, but primary optimizations happen through the Smart Grid with action buttons
- **Execute optimizations through a safety-first Action Queue** — all write operations are staged, reviewed, and executed with guardrails
- **Reduce wasted ad spend by 15%+** — through automated waste detection and one-click recommendations
- **Achieve time to first value under 5 minutes** — from signup to first meaningful insight

## Background Context

Google Ads management is a complex, expertise-intensive discipline where most SMB owners lack the 3-5+ years of experience needed for expert-level decisions. A typical $10K/month account with no expert management wastes $1,500-$3,000/month on poor keywords, missed negatives, and suboptimal bids — that's $18K-$36K/year in preventable loss.

The current landscape offers no solution that combines deep expertise, actual account access, actionable execution, affordable pricing, and a modern data-grid interface. Existing tools either require PPC knowledge (Optmyzr, WordStream), are expensive (agencies at $2K-$10K/month), or lack account access (ChatGPT). This application bridges that gap with an Airtable-style Smart Grid combined with AI chat.

**Key Product Insight:** Most users don't want a "dashboard" — they want a spreadsheet where they can see their data, make a business decision in 30 seconds, and move on. The Smart Grid delivers this.
