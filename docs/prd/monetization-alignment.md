# Monetization Alignment

## Freemium Model (Recommended)

| Tier | Accounts | Features | Price |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Free** | 1 | Read-only, basic AI chat, no actions | $0 |
| **Starter** | 3 | Full features, 100 actions/month | $29/mo |
| **Pro** | 10 | Full features, unlimited actions, priority support | $79/mo |
| **Agency** | 50 | Full features, white-label, API access | $199/mo |

## Usage-Based Considerations

- Action Queue executions could be metered
- AI chat tokens could have soft limits
- Data refresh frequency could vary by tier
